                                The digital platform of Manila City, ESKEDYUL: An E-Government Financial and Goods Assistance 
                                Transparency Website, is a collection of systems with functionality for monitoring, tracking, and 
                                request that will make claiming of financial aid or “ayuda” easier and hassle free. This system will 
                                guide them when it comes to the process that they will take in order to view their status online 
                                rather than to go directly to their local municipality just to know their status, it will also help 
                                them to receive their cash assistance by just requesting an E-Payment method, and they can also use 
                                the online appointment to claim their goods. The system, which is made available on desktop and 
                                mobile devices, intends to cater all the needy people when it comes to receiving their cash 
                                assistance and goods because this system will be open to all who will register from the system may 
                                it be in claiming their goods or cash assistance, and with great resources and developments, the 
                                developers ensure that these measures will be a huge leap for fair and fast distributions. 

                                As a result, we will only need what is absolutely necessary for the system to function. Before users 
                                agree to the terms and conditions and our privacy policy and provide their approval, no information 
                                will be gathered from them. If someone chooses to use our service, they will be informed of our 
                                policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information via this page. 

                                Legitimate reasons that have been decided upon and declared prior to or as soon as is practically 
                                practicable after collection are the only purposes for which we gather personal data. 

                                The users whole disclosure of information will be held in full confidentiality and used only for 
                                study. In accordance with the Data Privacy Act of 2012, the developers will not utilize any of the 
                                information that the users provide for direct marketing or other non-research purposes.

                                These applications along with other connected web applications, are part of the E-SKEDYUL Platform 
                                and are primarily designed for the assistance distribution, monitoring and transparency.
